# Lab6 Docs:

####  All files & folders I added to this lab are under the folder lab-isaiah.

* Included the following required files and folders:
  * **README.md** (this file)
  * **.gitignore**
  * **.eslintrc**
  * **.eslintignore**
  * **lib/** (empty)
  * **model/** (contains <em>client.js</em>)
  * Also included **package.json** & **node_modules**

#### Completed Feature Tasks:
Created `server.js` and began to work on feature tasks. Made good progress but had difficulties with `@dm` and `@exit`.`@exit` was a personal stretch and will be taken out prior to resubmission as it in not a custom command requirement and takes away from the technical requirements of: `when sockets are connected with the client pool they should be given event listeners for data, error, and close`.

#### Completed Custom Commands:

Created custom commands as required. As mentioned above, had difficulties with `@dm` but will figure it out and resubmit.

#### Additional Docs
